<section markdown="1">
This website serves as a portfolio and archive of my personal projects.

Besides being a student that studies programming and electronics
with predictably related hobbies, I have a particular interest
for <span class="hi1">retro computing</span>, and I'm an amateur
<span class="hi1">chiptune</span> and <span class="hi1">wind</span> musician.

I enjoy playing with programmable sound chips, flute, piccolo, and tenor saxophone,
and I especially love making music and homebrew video games
for the <span class="hi1">Nintendo Game Boy (1989)</span>.

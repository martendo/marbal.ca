Windows RG+ ("Really Good Plus") is collection of silly GUI elements
claiming to be a really good edition of Windows, made for jokes.

Most elements intentionally fail or fail to work properly.
For example, each digit button in "Calculator RG+"
actually inputs a random digit from 0 to 9,
and the equals button provides a random integer from 1 to 10000000.

After 7 years I realize that the buttons try to use a font called
"Segeo UI", a misspelling of "Segoe UI". Very unfortunate.
The screenshots in the gallery were taken on a Linux machine,
so it looks a little different from how it would on Windows,
where this program was written and tested.

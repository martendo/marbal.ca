Sinusoid is a simple Discord bot I wrote in 2020
to play MIDI files in voice channels,
because I thought the idea was fun.

It was thrown together very quickly in a single day
using [discord.js](https://discord.js.org)
and only used for about 5 days,
but it provided a good few hours of amusement.
It was especially fun when we gave it complex MIDI files
that weren't accurately recreated by the bot's simple waveform synthesis
or set the volume level absurdly high, like to 10000%.

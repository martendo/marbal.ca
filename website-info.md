## asset details for nerds
tile background image:
- a grid of 8&times;8 tiles in the fashion of the Game Boy
- made of various [box-drawing characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box-drawing_characters)
and other symbols
- glitchiness is reminiscent of writing garbage to a tilemap with valid tiles

I just found out about XKB's `misc:typo` option.
I probably should've known about it earlier, but it's now even easier
to type the special characters I wanted!
(Previous findings in [Keyboards &sect; Fancy Characters].)

With the `misc:typo` option, I can use <kbd>AltGr</kbd> for the em dash,
en dash, and minus sign for which I previously thought I needed the Compose key.
Plus, some key combinations are simply easier to remember, like
<kbd>AltGr</kbd><kbd>x</kbd>
instead of
<kbd>AltGr</kbd><kbd>=</kbd>
for the multiplication sign
&#x27E8;&times;&#x27E9;.

I'm still using the `us(altgr-intl)` layout,
since all the symbols provided by `misc:typo` are entered
at the third and fourth levels,
meaning they require <kbd>AltGr</kbd>.
With `us(basic)`, there is no <kbd>AltGr</kbd>,
so none of the extra characters would be accessible.

The Compose key could still be useful, too:
how else am I supposed to easily type "WHITE SMILING FACE"
&#x27E8;&#x263A;&#xFE0E;&#x27E9;
other than with
<kbd>Compose</kbd><kbd>:</kbd><kbd>)</kbd>?
Realistically, it would probably be rare for me to need the Compose key,
but I'd like to know that it's available if I need it.
I guess I would need it for the one time I want to type something like
O&#x2082;.
